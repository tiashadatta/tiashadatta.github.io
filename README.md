<h2>Unit 1 </h2>
<p>In Unit 2 we learned about the different elements of html. We learned about different tags, like one for a title, one for headers, one for lists, and one for a table. We learned how to add a video and how to add captions to the video. We learned how to add internal and external links. My favorite lesson in this unit was definitely the video and captioning part. This unit was very useful, but Iâ€™m excited for the CSS unit when I will learn to make my websites look prettier. Right now the website looks very basic and plain.
